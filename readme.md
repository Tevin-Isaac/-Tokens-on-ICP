## Tokens
On ICP, the DeFi ecosystem includes three types of assets:

- ICP token: The network‚Äôs native utility token.

- Cycles: The equivalent of ‚Äúgas‚Äù on ICP.

- ICRC tokens: Tokens that adhere to a set of ICRC standards used for defining fungible and non-fungible tokens.

### üü° Token Standards

The Internet Computer supports token standards under the **ICRC (Internet Computer Request for Comments)** initiative.

- **ICRC-1**: Fungible token base standard (similar to ERC-20)
- **ICRC-2**: Adds approvals for delegated transfers
- **ICRC-7**: NFT standard for non-fungible tokens
- **ICRC-37**: The ICRC-37 standard is an extension of ICRC-7 that provides additional functionality for an approval workflow.

> Most token launch platforms currently adopt **ICRC-1** as the base fungible token standard.


## ICRC1
ICRC-1
The ICRC-1 standard is for fungible tokens on ICP. It is considered the 'base' standard and intentionally excludes certain features and functions, such as:

* Reliable transaction notifications for smart contracts.

* A block structure and the interface for fetching blocks.

* Pre-signed transactions.

ICRC-1 supports extensions of this standard to implement these missing functions, and the icrc1_supported_standards endpoint can be queried to return the name of all supported extensions.

Example ICRC-1 tokens on ICP include:
